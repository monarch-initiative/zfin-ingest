# ZFIN

ZFIN is the Zebrafish Model Organism Database.

## Gene to Phenotype

This ingest uses ZFIN's clean gene phenotype download file, which only contains phenotypes which can safely be associated to a single affected gene. This ingest is distinct from the Alliance phenotype index because ZFIN builds Entity-Quality-Entity phenotype statements that can be built from post-composed terms (E1a+E1b+Q+E2a+E2b).
